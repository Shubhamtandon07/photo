Hello Sustainable-procurement,

To achieve responsible sourcing, suppliers must adhere to several key requirements: => Complete the latest version of the Sustainability Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) on the SUPPLIERASSURANCE platform for the planned production site before awarding. This questionnaire is developed by the Drive Sustainability initiative. => Use electricity from renewable energies at tier 1 for production processes, as outlined in the "Green electricity Standard Group AG" document. => Ensure all products delivered are produced CO-neutral across all value creation stages by 1/1/2039, including both your own production sites and the upstream supply chain. These requirements apply to all production plants and subsidiaries involved in supplying volumes. If there are changes in the production site or if no result has been shared for the planned location, the responsible purchaser should be informed immediately.

Best regards,
Shubham
